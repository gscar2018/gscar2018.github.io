            <p class="text">One of the main reasons I started playing guitar was inspiration. I remember listening to one of my favorite artists: Joe Satriani. 
                I listened to one of his live shows and was blow away by his guitar playing. From that moment on I wanted to play guitar.
                 All of this was in 2016 and I have been playing guitar ever since </p>

            <p class="text">In total I have probably spent about 3500$ on all of my guitar equipment. It may seem alot but you have to consider this is over a 7 year period.
                 Also I play my guitars almost everyday so I get my value out of them </p>

                <p class="text">Though it isnt always joyful; sometimes it can be extremely frustrating to play. What I mean my this is sometimes you reach a point in playing where you dont seem to get any better. 
                    This stagnation has cause me to not want to play. I had to push through the struggle and keep playing. Once you get over the stagnation it's very rewarding to see myself improve </p>
