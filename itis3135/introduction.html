            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I grew up in England and moved to America about 13 years ago. 
                    In my free time I like to play music; specifically guitar.</li>
                <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> My professional background isn't Extensive. 
                    During covid I used to work at UPS which is how 
                    I was able to afford to take summer courses at UNC Charlotte. </li>
                <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I got my Associates in Science at 
                    a community college before transferring here to UNC Charlotte. 
                    Currently I am a senior here at UNC Charlotte looking to graduate in Spring of 2024.</li>
                <li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> I honestly don't have much experience 
                    with web design or creating websites.</li>
                <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Windows 11 PC</li>
                <li>Courses I'm Taking & Why:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>ITCS3112 - Dsgn & Imp Object-oriented Sys:</strong> It's a course that will help me refine my 
                            coding skills in creating a coding project.</li>
                        <li><strong>ITIS3135 - Web App Design and Development:</strong> Web development might be something I'm interested in getting into.
                            So I decided to take the course to see if it's something I want to do professionally.</li>
                        <li><strong>ITIS3310 - Software Arch & Design:</strong> Design is always something I've been fascinated with; so taking a design course relating 
                            to Software is something I'm interested in.</li>
                        <li><strong>ITSC2181 - Introduction to Computer Systems:</strong> This is required for my major but understanding how a computer utilizes hardware in order to execute code is important. Allows me to create more effective 
                            and efficient code knowing the limitations a hardware has.</li>
                        <li><strong>ITSC3155 - Software Engineering:</strong> Software engineering is something 
                            I want to do so taking the course is essential in helping me professionally. </li>
                    </ul>
