                <h3>Good Site</h3>
                <a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple</a>
                <p class="sitetext">Apple's website which color design is in black and white; 
                    they grab the user's attention through minimalism and centered big text. 
                    For instance when you open the site the first thing you see is Apple's new iphone. 
                    The contrast from the colors of black and white grab your attention. Since Apple is trying to sell a product 
                    it is important for people browsing the website to easily see them.</p>
                    <ul class="siteunorder">
                        <li>Contrast: While it is just basic colors like black and white;
                            it does create good contrast. There's constrast in how text is layout on the site, creating visual interest</li>
                        <li>Repetition: The layout of the text repeats and is the same for all the products on the main page. 
                            So you don't get lost and creates unity on the page</li>
                        <li>Alignment: The site creates boxes which all align with one another. 
                            These grids make the site consistent and make the site visually pleasing to navigate through.</li>
                        <li>Proximity: Things related to a product are grouped together; 
                            for instance, the new iphone has links and the date of release all group together. </li>
                    </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="flex-box">
                <h3>Bad site</h3>
                <a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com">Berkshire hathaway</a>
                <p class="sitetext">The site is some sort of reminant of the old internet; this is the company Berkshire Hathaway current site. 
                    The site lacks any design and is pretty bare bones nothing on the site really grabs your attention. It seems strange a company worth almost a trillion dollars has a site as basic as this. 
                    Seems like a site I would make since I only have 4 weeks working with html and css. </p>
                <ul class="siteunorder">
                    <li>Contrast: There is almost none almost everything on the site is the same size; same said with the colors. </li>
                    <li>Repetition: There is repetition on the site but not in a good way. The repetition comes form a lack of interesting or any design. </li>
                    <li>Alignment: The bottom footer is not align and is kindof distracting. </li>
                    <li>Proximity: There seems to be no logical spacing, everything is kinda placed on the site in a list randomly</li>
                </ul>
