        <p class="textcolor" >Hello! My name is Amelia, I live with my fiance in Statesville, NC with our three rescue cats and a bearded dragon.
            I am a self-taught artist of 15 years specializing in digital paintings. Occasionally I work with physical mediums such as knitting, and oil paintings.  I've worked as a comissioned artist for around 7 years now, specializing in concept art, and character design sheets. 
            If you have any questions, would like to work together, or would like an estimate, feel free to message me.</p>
